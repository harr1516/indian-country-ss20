     <p>The Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe faces displacement due to the impact of rising sea levels in southern Louisiana. This non-federally recognized tribe is forced to relocate to higher ground, which is causing the loss of ancestral burial grounds and a disruption to the community's way of life. Communities around the world are experiencing the effects of climate change: rising sea levels, increasingly erratic weather patterns, an increase in wildfires, and longer periods of drought. Rarely discussed is the effect that this has on the physical land of Indigenous communities, especially concerning their ancestral grave sites and living conditions. Tribes that are not federally recognized face even greater challenges, such as not receiving funds to relocate or not being included in climate change policy conversations in their state or federal governments. This is gradually improving, but for many Indigenous communities, like the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw, it is too late.

        <h3>Climate Change and Indigenous Communities</h3>
<hr>

    <p>As climate change continues to ravage communities around the globe, Indigenous communities persistently face unique challenges. The economies, settlement locations, and cultural lifestyles of Indigenous communities around North America are under immense threat. Indigenous peoples are often left out of climate change activism discussions at the state and federal levels, which has led many universities to develop research projects that aim to represent Indigenous communities. One such example is a Climate Change Adaptation Plan in response to sea level rise for the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana, which is conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). This plan is helping the Chitimacha tribe prevent, plan, and prepare for current and future environmental challenges by improving education and awareness of climate change. The Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana is one of four federally recognized tribes in Louisiana, which means it receives federal funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other disaster-relief organizations (“A Climate Change Adaptation Plan,” n.d.). Although this tribe is receiving federal assistance, all Indigenous communities are extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
    </p>
    <p>The Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw is a non-federally recognized, or unrecognized, tribe of Louisiana, so it is left out of the USGS adaptation plan and FEMA funding. The Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw and other unrecognized tribes struggle to get assistance in prevention and mitigation planning. Additionally, research is often rarely conducted on their lands, which results in an absence of federal relocation funding. Unrecognized coastal Indigenous peoples are also faced with economic and food security challenges. Coastal Indigenous peoples consume seafood at a rate of 74 kg per capita<sup>-1</sup>-year<sup>-1</sup>, while the global average (on a national level) is 19 kg-capita<sup>-1</sup>-year<sup>-1</sup> (<a href="#Reference">Cisneros-Montemayor et. al., 2016</a>). The sinking of coastal Indigenous land is driving these communities to find new food sources and economic opportunities. This proves one aspect of grounded normativity, which is a term often used to describe the land as the base of political systems, economy, and culture (<a href="#Reference_5">Simpson, 2017</a>). The disappearing land disrupts the interconnectivity included in the grounded normativity concept.

    <p>Burial and ceremonial sites are also vanishing due to rising sea levels. On the northern Gulf Coast of Florida, archaeologists have discovered stratified archaeological sites that have been submerged (<a href="#Reference_4">McFadden, 2014</a>). The northern Gulf Coast, specifically the Big Bend region, is home to many Indigenous groups. Among these submerged stratified sites are Paleoindian burial and ceremonial sites, which is important ancestral history for the Indigenous people of the Big Bend region (<a href="#Reference_2">Faught, 2004</a>). Louisiana’s striking similarities in landscape to this region demonstrates the inevitable future of Indigenous burial and ceremonial sites. Tribes like the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw are being forced to relocate to higher ground, leaving their burial sites behind to be forever destroyed.

        <h3>History of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw</h3>
      <hr>
      <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=""></a>

      <p> Shortly after the 1830 Indian Removal Act was passed in the United States, <a href="http://www.isledejeancharles.com/island" target="blank">according to the oral history of the tribe</a>, a Frenchman married a Native American woman and was subsequently disowned by his own family. They decided to move to an island that had been used by the Frenchman’s father, Jean Charles Naquin, to meet with a pirate. The couple’s children married those from the combined Biloxi-Chitimacha tribe and the Choctaw tribe who moved onto the island to create the Isle de Jean Charles band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe. For many decades, the land of the Isle de Jean Charles was considered by the United States government to be uninhabitable, but the tribe was able to buy the land by 1880. The tribe survived from gardening and fishing, however 98% of the land is now submerged in water due to rising sea levels since the 1950s (<a href="#Reference_6">Mei, 2017</a>).</p>
