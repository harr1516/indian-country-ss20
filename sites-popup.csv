But, until governments provide equal accessibility, many individuals and communities will continue to be negatively affected by lack of affordable internet access, and lack of access in their community all together. Schools, businesses, and even government offices, assume that most people have a computer and internet in the home. And while that may be true, most, isn’t all, so people are being left behind by this way of thinking. Even more unfortunate, the people that are being left behind in this matter, are the already vulnerable and/or targeted groups of our world, and are disproportionately members of Native American Tribes. To combat this inequality, many rural Native Tribes are creating their own internet providers to provide their communities with the necessary tools and resources to access the internet. We look here, at the Hopi Tribe’s response to the lack of connectivity they faced and their plan--and execution--to not only get online, but to use the internet to boost their community’s economy and education programs.",<a href='sites/digitaldivide/digitaldivide.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>
60.038326,-77.275539,<h3>Inuit Midwifery</h3>,<h4>Inuit</h4>,"The Inuit are a group of Indigenous peoples that are located in the arctic regions of Canada. The Inuit inhabit what is called Nunangat which encompasses much of arctic Canada spanning from Alaska to Greenland (Inuit Tapirkit Kanatami). The Inuit traditional way of life has been under attack ever since the introduction of Europeans (Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada 2006). One of these ways of life is the traditional birthing methods of the Inuit that utilize midwifery. These traditional methods refer to a midwifery system in which women give birth at home within the family group (Douglass 2006). The Canadian government started to intervene in the mid 1900s on the medical practices of the Inuit and began to force pregnant women to fly south to have their children in Canadian hospitals (Bronstein 2015). This forced removal of women from their home community during childbirth has had numerous negative effects on Inuit communities. These communities have begun actively resisting the Canadian government by establishing their own medical facilities and keeping women in the Inuit community during childbirth.

Focusing on how the media is representing these women vs. the way that other violent crimes are addressed. This is a main issue when looking at deeply routed impressions and perceptions of Native American women in the media's image, from pocahontas to law enforcements lack of protection for Indgineous women sex workers. This major issue has not been represented well, especially when looking at astonishing statistics. We hope to address many examples of these major issues and shine lights on the way the media has interacted with this issue in the past and present.",<a href='sites/lerouxsmith1/lerouxsmith1.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>

Throughout history, the tribe has rejected the United States Government’s mistreatment and threats to their autonomy, and they continue this resistance today protesting President Trump’s border wall. The wall will split up the tribe and families who live on either side of the border, destroy religious sites and natural resources like a vital desert aquifer and the native saguaro cactus population sacred to the tribe if it is not stopped.",<a href='sites/climate-project/climate-project.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>

They have come together to provide awareness and prevention for the ongoing issue surrounding missing and murdered indigenous women. They host research clinics involving the problem (such as Sisters in Spirit), and update their final reports (from the National Inquiry) consistently. The NWAC is playing an active role in the prevention of Canada's missing and murdered native women, and our research will reiterate this. Moreover, scholars across the nation are addressing this issue with equal force. Anthropologists give a detailed account of the implications, which provides society with a better understanding. Our focus will reside in details on this prevention project taking place through the NWAC, such as a discussion of the Sisters in Spirit and You Are Not Alone policies, as well as aligning it with anthropological theory regarding the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women.",<a href='sites/mmindigenouswomen/name1.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>

We would like to research the correlation between heart disease in Alaska Native Tribes and their location in relation to the Alaska Native Medical Center. Being far from urban settings that provide medical support is a huge disadvantage for a lot of Alaskan Native Tribes. We know that cardiovascular disease is among the number one cause of death in these communities and we would like to know the varying aspects of their life that may contribute to this issue. We want to focus on the Yupik and Inupiat populations and the specific factors that are attributed to the severely high rates of cardiovascular disease along with the struggles of having no available medical support within the general vicinity.",<a href='sites/yupik-inupiat-cardiovascular-issues/yupik-inupiat-cardiovascular-issues.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>

There are mental health disparities that have become a contemporary part of their culture. In looking broadly at the issues, it can be seen that PTSD is part of the explanatory model that then sheds light on such issues as alcoholism in the older generations and now includes substance abuse within the younger generations. This case study will concentrate on the state of Alaska’s Native Aleut Tribe or Inc. We will examine the mental health effects on indigenous peoples on the Aleutian northern peninsula. This 2,100 square mile chain of sedimentary rocks has historically experienced monumental changes. (R. Hagenstein, T. Ricketts 1995). Through analysis on the state of mental health among tribal members we will identify more challenging and long-term effects of PTSD, Alcoholism (among adults), and other mental illnesses. Some of which have been noted to be effects of colonialism. ",<a href='sites/an-mentalhealth/an-mentalhealth.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>
29.398269,-90.489111,<h3>The Washing Away of a Culture</h3>,<h4>The Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Tribe</h4>,"Communities around the world are experiencing the effects of climate change: rising sea levels, increasingly erratic weather patterns, an increase in wildfires, and longer periods of drought. Rarely spoken about is the effect that this has on the physical land of indigenous communities, especially concerning their ancestral grave sites and living conditions. Tribes that are not federally recognized face even greater challenges, such as not receiving funds to relocate or not being included in climate change policy conversations in their state or federal governments. The action taken by the Biloxi Chitimacha Choctaw, a non-federally recognized tribe, to relocate to higher ground is causing culture loss and a disconnect of their people because of the special connection they have with the land they are losing. The exploration of these issues hopes to shed light on the response of the Biloxi Chitimacha Choctaw due to their displacement they face due to the impact of rising sea levels in Southern Louisiana.",<a href='sites/washing-away-a-culture.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>

The main case we will be looking at with Media coverage of this issue is the REDress Campaign which was created by artist Jamie Black to highlight the issues presented in these community relating to polices work at finding these women, and how prominent these cases are in the Indigenous Community. We plan on looking at multiple different news outlets to see the effects that this campaign has had on these issues and how hard it has been for word to spread on this topic. We also plan on focusing on the Red River as our location, as that is where many bodies have been found, as well as media coverage on these events.
