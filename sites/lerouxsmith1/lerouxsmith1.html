  <h1> Is This A Canadian Genocide? </h1>
  <h3> Winnepeg, Canada </h3>

         <h3> History of Violance Against Indigenous Women </h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>  Three decades of missing and murdered Indigenous women amounts to a “Canadian genocide.” Thousands of Indigenous women
        have been lost to the Canadian genocide to date. The “persistent and deliberate human and Indigenous rights violations
        and abuses are the root cause behind Canada’s staggering rates of violence.” The inquiry concluded that Canada has committed a
        genocide against the Indigenous peoples within its colonial borders, and is continuing to maintain systems and structures that result in Indigenous women and
        girls and Two-Spirit people experiencing a disproportionate amount of violence. The Indigenous people have long understood — that the violence
        they experience is a product of settler colonialism. The continuation of the Canadian settler state requires the destabilization of Indigenous communities —
        and a part of this stabilization has involved rampant gender-based violence to uphold the legitimacy of the settler state’s rule over land and water.
        While settler colonialism impacts Indigenous peoples of all genders, it makes women, girls and Two-Spirit people especially vulnerable to violence.</p>

        <h3> The Media's Attention </h3>
      <hr>
        <p> Lack of media could be bringing more danger to missing and murdered women in Winnepg, Canada. The lack of awareness they bring to these women
         who go missing compared to other races and genders is boggling. I bring a point in our title of this project, bringing forth the idea that, it could be possible that
          less violence towards these indigenous women and girls could be taking place, if media were to do its job without discrimination and bring awarness to the issue.
        <h4> The REDress Project </h4>

        <figcaption><a href="#" rel="" data-toggle="" data-content=" "> </a></figcaption>
        </figure>
          <p> The Red Dress Campaign is "about bringing awareness to those women who have gone missing, who have been murdered, who we're still searching for, to bring
            awareness to our communities, to bring awareness also to our families and the continued struggle and grief that they are experiencing and wanting to give
            acknowledgement in a respectful way and tell our stories," said Geesohns Manitowabi, an organizer of the event.
        <h4> Drag The Red </h4>
        <img src="img/redriverwomen.jpg" width="50%">
          <p> Drag the Red is a nonprofit organization based out of Winnipeg, Ontario with hopes of helping identify missing indigenous women in the Red River. This organization has existed since 2014,
             following the death of Tina Fontaine, a 15 year old indigenous woman who was found at the bottom of the river. This led to a outcry from the tribal members, leading to the creation of Drag the Red.
             Drag the Red is composed of multiple first nations tribal members willing to dedicate hardwork and effort to find justice for the murdered and missing indigenous women of Winnipeg. This group has
             received nationwide media coverage, yet not as much as other campaigns, such as the REDress project.
          <p>The largest media feature the Drag the Red campaign has had so far has been a short Vice Documentary, airing in 2015 and as of April 13th 2020 has close to 372,000 views. This media representation
            is composed of 22 minutes of interviews and background on the missing and murdered indigenous women that these search teams are motivated by, as well as shedding light on the lack of representation
            and funding these types of organizations have. While this documentary was helpful for the organization and actually funding a valuable source of fixing a large component of the issue surrounding
            the Canadian Genocide, this only lasted for a short time period. Other media formats, such as local newspapers have shed light on this issue, yet large amounts of funding are still being searched
            for as they are not supported by the Winnipeg police department for their dragging of the river bed, as well as needing the equipment (boats and hooks) for this operation.
