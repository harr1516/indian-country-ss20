		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>For Indigneous youth, it is clear there is a connection between the development of personal/cultural identity and exposure to traditional arts and culture practices. Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron, is a cultural hub where multitudinous opportunities are accessible for Indigenous people of all ages, especially Indigenous youth, to partake in traditional activities in order to explore and cultivate the development of their identity as Indigenous persons.

      <h4> Introduction </h4>
      <hr>
      <P>Discovering one’s specific place in society is a journey that we all have to make throughout our youth and into adulthood. Figuring out how to answer the question of who we are is difficult and different for every individual. It requires taking a look at the things we enjoy, the people we spend our time with, who we want to be in the future, where our family comes from, and how we’ve grown up. Though it sounds simple enough, certain groups, especially minorities including
  Indigenous peoples, have to approach these questions with a different perspective. Throughout history they have continuously had their place in society and validity questioned and attacked by majority groups. This fact only emphasizes the importance that they be able to connect with their traditions and cultural practices in order to aid in the development and cultivation of personal identities as well as identities within their culture and maintain a connection.

	Located in the middle of Lake Huron in Ontario, Canada, Manitoulin Island is the largest freshwater island in the entire world. Manitoulin means spirit island in Anishinaabemowin and the Anishinaabe people (Anishinaabek) consider the island sacred. In 1836, the island was declared a refuge where native people would be able to live apart from “white civilization”. However, as is the story with many native lands, the Anishinaabek have gone through a lot to claim their place on the Island. In
  1862, the government divided up the island to make space for non-native settlements, creating several different reserves in the process (Wikwemikong). Now, Manitoulin Island is home to six Anishinaabek First Nations, 40% of the population comes from one of these. The island has become a cultural hub where multitudinous opportunities are accessible for Indigenous people, and especially Indigenous youth, to partake in such traditional activities in order to explore their identity as Indigenous
  persons. On the island there are many places to learn about Indigneous culture and practices including the Debajehmujig Creation Centre, the only professional theater on reserve land in Canada, Point Grondine Park, where one can participate in workshops teaching about traditional Indigneous medicine, and the Ojibwe Cultural Foundation which was created to preserve language, culture, arts, and traditions of the Anishinaabe people (Desnoyers-Picard).
